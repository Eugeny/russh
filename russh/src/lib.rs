//! Server and client SSH asynchronous library, based on tokio/futures.
//!
//! The normal way to use this library, both for clients and for
//! servers, is by creating *handlers*, i.e. types that implement
//! `client::Handler` for clients and `server::Handler` for
//! servers.
//!
//! * [Writing SSH clients - the `russh::client` module](client)
//! * [Writing SSH servers - the `russh::server` module](server)
//!
//! # Using non-socket IO / writing tunnels
//!
//! The easy way to implement SSH tunnels, like `ProxyCommand` for
//! OpenSSH, is to use the `russh-config` crate, and use the
//! `Stream::tcp_connect` or `Stream::proxy_command` methods of that
//! crate. That crate is a very lightweight layer above Russh, only
//! implementing for external commands the traits used for sockets.
//!
//! # The SSH protocol
//!
//! If we exclude the key exchange and authentication phases, handled
//! by Russh behind the scenes, the rest of the SSH protocol is
//! relatively simple: clients and servers open *channels*, which are
//! just integers used to handle multiple requests in parallel in a
//! single connection. Once a client has obtained a `ChannelId` by
//! calling one of the many `channel_open_…` methods of
//! `client::Connection`, the client may send exec requests and data
//! to the server.
//!
//! A simple client just asking the server to run one command will
//! usually start by calling
//! `client::Connection::channel_open_session`, then
//! `client::Connection::exec`, then possibly
//! `client::Connection::data` a number of times to send data to the
//! command's standard input, and finally `Connection::channel_eof`
//! and `Connection::channel_close`.
//!
//! # Design principles
//!
//! The main goal of this library is conciseness, reduced size, and
//! readability of the library's code.
//!
//! One non-goal is to implement all possible cryptographic algorithms
//! published since the initial release of SSH. Technical debt is
//! easily acquired, and we would need a very strong reason to go
//! against this principle. If you are designing a system from
//! scratch, we urge you to consider recent cryptographic primitives
//! such as Ed25519 for public key cryptography, and Chacha20-Poly1305
//! for symmetric cryptography and MAC.
//!
//! # Internal details of the event loop
//!
//! The read/write methods for server or client sessions often queue data
//! to be sent, rather than sending it immediately. This is because the
//! data sent to the remote side is buffered, because it needs to be
//! encrypted first, and encryption works on buffers, and for many
//! algorithms, not in place.
//!
//! Hence, the event loop keeps waiting for incoming packets, reacts
//! to them by calling the provided `Handler`, which fills some
//! buffers. If the buffers are non-empty, the event loop then sends
//! them to the socket, flushes the socket, empties the buffers and
//! starts again. In the special case of the server, unsolicited
//! messages sent through a `server::Handle` are processed when there
//! is no incoming packet to read.
